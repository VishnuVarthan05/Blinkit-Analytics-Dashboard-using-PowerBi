Project Overview
This project involves creating interactive dashboards to analyze a decade's worth of sales data, with a specific focus on dairy items. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total sales, sales trends by year, fat content distribution, and sales by location type. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive overview of all item types, showcasing total sales, sales trends, item rankings by sales, and similar distribution metrics for fat content and location types.
